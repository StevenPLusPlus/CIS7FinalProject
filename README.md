# Basic Instructions
- First run program
- When the program asks if you would like to (1) encrypt, (2) decrypt, or (3) options. Make sure to input one of those numbers since other numbers will just loop and anything other than a number will break the program
- After selecting either decryption or encryption, make sure to input letters without a space for the message, and lowercase letters without a space for the key, while also making sure that the key is < message length
- When prompt asks if you would like to continue, typing 'no' will quit the program while typing in anything else will act as 'yes'
